##About
For this competition we were given the theme "stupid" and so, disregarding all attempts to make a political/social statement, I instead made a really silly game about murdering pigs who had eaten your entire livestock during the night

The game features four levels, comprising of 4 rooms (1 optional) and then a final boss room

##Dependencies
Note: This project relies on RAIN{Indie} which I believe cannot be distributed in non binary form; to build the project please download RAIN{Indie} from the Rival Theory themselves; the version used was 1.3.3
